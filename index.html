            <h2>A little about myself</h2>
            <p>I'm an aspiring software developer located in the Brisbane region of Australia. I'm interested in lower level languages such as C++ and C, but also have an afinity for python and various other higher level languages.</p>
            <p>I began my programming journey learning through online courses through Coursera, Udemy and EdX. Now I am half way through my second year of university moving forward to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology majoing in Applied Computer Science and Data Analytics</p>
            <p>So far I have written various front-end development projects and just completed a course focusing on object-orientated design</p>
            <p>My goal is to obtain a software development position working with data. I have an interest in Machine Learning.</p>

                <h2>A little about my skills</h2>
                <p>My main experience so far lies in front-end web development. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make simple websites to show case programming skills we have learnt in class</p>
                <p>As my course has progressed my skills have extended to learning the linux operating system, bash scripting, C++ and object orietated programming</p>
                <p>Future courses will develop skills in computational thinking using python, as well understanding programming data structures and the algorithms that can manipulate and search those data structures.</p>
